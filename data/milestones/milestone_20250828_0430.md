Pool Scout Pro - System Milestone Documentation
System Overview

Pool Scout Pro is an inspection report management system for Sacramento County pool inspections. The system searches EMD (Environmental Management Department) records, downloads PDF inspection reports, extracts data, and stores it in a normalized database with inspection ID-based duplicate detection and date verification.
Core Philosophy: Download ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Database (transactional flow ensures data consistency)

Current System Status: Enterprise-ready system with comprehensive resilience architecture. Search and download systems operational with intelligent failure recovery, health monitoring, automatic retry mechanisms, separated database architecture for scalability, multi-session Selenium configuration for concurrent operations, and comprehensive equipment tracking with violation deadline extraction.

!!! ALWAYS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN EVERY MILESTONE UPDATE !!!
MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Any AI assistant must read and acknowledge these development rules before making ANY code changes:

VIOLATION OF THESE RULES = IMMEDIATE CORRECTION REQUIRED

(1) ALWAYS GET PERMISSION BEFORE GENERATING CODE - Never auto-generate code without explicit permission. Confirm understanding before any code generation
(2) INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT - One step at a time, confirm each change works
(3) All commands must run from project root.
(4) NEVER MODIFY FILES WITHOUT SEEING THEM FIRST - Always examine current content
(5)mCLEAR STEP DELINEATION - Structure commands with clear step comments
(6) NEVER USE TEST/SAMPLE DATA IN PRODUCTION - Do not create test/sample reports, or dummy data in the production database or file system. Use real data from search results only, or work in a separate development environment.
(7) Keep responses short and to the point - Avoiding detailed explanations unless explicitly requested, to conserve chat space.

(8) ALWAYS use dev-tools workflow. ALL changes via: ./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh. Apply changes via safe-edit.sh or safe-patch.sh, never direct file modification.

üõ†Ô∏è MANDATORY DEV-TOOLS WORKFLOW

./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh validate <file> - Check syntax BEFORE changes
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh edit <target> <new> - Safe file replacement with auto-backup
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh patch <target> <patch> - Apply git patches safely
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh rollback <file> - Emergency restore from backup
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh restart - Test changes with service restart
NEVER manually edit files - Use dev-tools for ALL modifications

Latest backup restoration: Use LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t data/backups/filename.* | head -1) pattern for automatic rollback
Auto-restart after modifications: Dev-workflow needs automatic restart after JS/HTML/Python file changes

‚úÖ Development Workflow Example:

bash# 1. Examine current file
cat src/services/pdf_downloader.py

# 2. Create new version in /tmp/
cat > /tmp/updated_downloader.py << 'EOF'
# Updated content here
EOF

# 3. Validate before applying
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh validate /tmp/updated_downloader.py

# 4. Apply safely with automatic backup
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh edit src/services/pdf_downloader.py /tmp/updated_downloader.py

# 5. Test immediately
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh restart

# 6. Verify functionality
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh status
üìô Emergency Recovery
bash# View available backups
ls -la data/backups/pdf_downloader.py.*

# Restore from latest backup
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh rollback src/services/pdf_downloader.py

# Restart service after rollback
./dev-tools/dev-workflow.sh restart
CRITICAL: This development system is MANDATORY for all code changes. It prevents the production system corruption that the development rules are designed to avoid.

Hybrid Monitoring Architecture

Application Monitor (robust_selenium_monitor.py):

Scope: Session management, cleanup, pre-download health verification
Speed: Immediate detection and resolution of session issues
Capabilities: Session cleanup, stuck session detection, resource management
Limitation: No container restart capability (runs inside container)


External Monitor (/usr/local/bin/selenium_monitor.sh):

Scope: Container health, infrastructure restarts, system-level recovery
Frequency: Every 3 minutes via cron job
Capabilities: Container restart, failure alerting, infrastructure management
Docker Access: Full container management from host system


Division of Labor: Fast session issues handled by application, infrastructure issues by external monitor

Enterprise Database Architecture

Purpose: Separate business data from operational data for scalability and data lifecycle management
Implementation: Two-database architecture with clear separation of concerns
Databases:

inspection_data.db - Business data (facilities, reports, violations, equipment)
system_management.db - Operational data (failed downloads, health status, search timing, retry queues)


Benefits: Independent backup strategies, different retention policies, scalable to multiple counties

Comprehensive External Monitoring System

Purpose: Ensure system availability and automatic recovery from infrastructure failures
Components:

Selenium Health Monitor (/usr/local/bin/selenium_monitor.sh) - Runs every 3 minutes
Container Restart Capability - Automatically restarts unhealthy Selenium containers
Alerting System - Logs alerts to /var/log/pool_scout_alerts.log for persistent failures
Scheduled Retry Processing (/usr/local/bin/retry_job.sh) - Runs every hour


Health Checks: HTTP status endpoint monitoring with container readiness verification
Recovery Actions: Automatic container restart, exponential backoff retry, failure escalation

Intelligent Download Retry Logic

Purpose: Comprehensive failure recovery with infrastructure health awareness
Implementation:

3 immediate retry attempts with Selenium health checks on each failure
Selenium recovery - Restart container and retry if infrastructure issue detected
Mark for later retry - Store persistent failures in system database for scheduled processing
Dead letter queue - Failed downloads tracked with retry counts and scheduling


Retry Scheduling: 1-hour delay for later retry attempts with retry_candidates view for processing
Failure Classification: Distinguishes infrastructure failures (Selenium) from content failures (network/PDF)

Inspection ID-Based Duplicate Detection

Purpose: Prevent duplicate downloads using precise inspection ID matching
Implementation: Extracts inspection ID from PDF URLs for accurate duplicate checking
Logic: Primary check via inspection_id, fallback to facility name with permissive threshold
Pattern: Multiple inspection reports per facility are supported and expected

Date Verification System

Purpose: Ensure inspection reports are saved with correct dates
Implementation: Extracts actual inspection date from PDF content (Date Entered: MM/DD/YYYY)
Verification: Compares PDF date vs search parameters with mismatch logging
File Naming: Uses actual inspection date in filename (not search date)

Transactional Download Processing with Enterprise Resilience

Single-Flight Lock: Prevents concurrent downloads via DownloadLockService
Atomic Operations: Download ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Database (all succeed or all fail)
Failure Recovery: Failed downloads stored for enterprise retry via FailedDownloadService
File Integrity: PDF validation and proper cleanup on errors
Progress Tracking: Real-time download progress with frontend polling system
Health Monitoring: Pre-flight Selenium health checks with automatic recovery
Multi-Level Retry:

Level 1: 3 immediate attempts with Selenium health checks per failure
Level 2: Automatic container restart and immediate retry for infrastructure issues
Level 3: Mark for later retry (1-hour delay) for persistent failures
Level 4: Scheduled retry processing via cron job (hourly)


Queue Management: Failed facility tracking with intelligent retry scheduling
Enterprise Recovery: Comprehensive failure classification and appropriate response actions
Concurrent Processing: Multiple PDF downloads with session management and resource optimization

Comprehensive Resilience Architecture

4-Level Resilience Strategy:

Level 1: Application retry logic (3 immediate attempts with health checks)
Level 2: Infrastructure recovery (automatic Selenium container restart)
Level 3: Scheduled retry processing (hourly cron job for persistent failures)
Level 4: External monitoring and alerting (3-minute health checks with restart capability)


Session-Level Resilience: Multi-session architecture prevents single point of failure
Proactive Protection: Selenium health verification before download initiation
Reactive Recovery: Immediate container restart and retry for infrastructure failures
Intelligence Failure Classification: Distinguish infrastructure vs content failures for appropriate response
Enterprise Monitoring: External monitoring script with container management and alerting
Dead Letter Queue: Persistent failure tracking with retry_candidates view for efficient processing
Comprehensive Logging: Detailed visibility into all failure modes and recovery actions

Multiple Reports Per Facility

Business Logic: Facilities commonly have multiple inspection reports on the same date
Valid Scenarios: Multiple features (pool + spa), re-inspections, follow-up compliance checks
Database Design: inspection_reports table stores individual reports (many-to-one with facilities)
Counting Logic: COUNT(*) = Total reports, COUNT(DISTINCT facility_id) = Unique facilities
Frontend Display: Shows facility count, not report count

Comprehensive Equipment Tracking

Purpose: Track all equipment types with detailed specifications for regulatory compliance and analytics
Implementation: New equipment table with dedicated fields for multiple pumps, filters, sanitizers, drains, and equalizers
Equipment Types Supported:

Filter Pumps: Up to 3 pumps with make, model, HP tracking

Equalizers: Model and install date tracking


Extraction Features: Multi-line equipment parsing handles complex PDF formats with equipment data spanning multiple lines
Analytics Ready: Enables queries like "How many Hayward pumps are installed?" or "Facilities with outdated equipment"

Advanced Violation Processing

Purpose: Extract comprehensive violation data with corrective action deadlines for compliance tracking
Implementation: Enhanced violation parsing with cross-contamination prevention and deadline extraction
Features:

Deadline Extraction: Automatically extracts "correct within X days" timeframes into searchable field
Clean Text Processing: Removes page artifacts, headers, and formatting issues from violation descriptions
Boundary Detection: Prevents mixing of observations and code descriptions between violations
Major Violation Detection: Automatically identifies and flags major violations
Severity Scoring: Assigns severity levels (1=minor, 3=major) for priority handling


Database Fields: Violation code, title, observations, code description, major flag, severity level, and correction deadline days
Compliance Queries: Enables searches like "All violations requiring correction within 7 days" for priority management

Unified Progress System

Purpose: Streamlined user feedback for all operations with visual distinction between facility types
Implementation: Single inline progress component in search header with contextual messaging
Features:

Contextual messages: "Searching EMD Site...please wait" during searches
Completion feedback: "X new reports found" or "No new reports found"
Animated spinner icon for active operations
Automatic hiding after completion with 3-second display delay
Compact design that doesn't expand header height
