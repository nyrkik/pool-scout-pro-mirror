🔒 MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT RULES (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
Code Update Strategy

❌ NO surgical code changes - leads to wasted time hunting syntax errors
❌ NO partial snippets or incomplete edits
❌ NO "enhanced" code generation without explicit request
❌ NO code generation without user permission - always ask first
❌ NO assumptions or "improvements" to working code - preserve exact logic
✅ Complete file rewrites using cat > filename.py << 'EOF'
✅ Complete functions/modules/classes as full units
✅ Terminal-ready commands for immediate copy/paste execution

Service Boundaries (ENFORCED)

❌ NO business logic in route files - routes call services only
❌ NO mixed service concerns - one service, one responsibility
❌ NO "convenient" shortcuts - maintain clean boundaries
❌ NO code generation without backup - always backup before changes
✅ Services have single, clear purpose
✅ Easy to debug - problems isolated to correct service

Backup Protocol (MANDATORY)
bash# Before ANY changes to critical files
python3 -c "from backup_system import CodeBackupSystem; backup = CodeBackupSystem(); backup.backup_file('filename.py', 'reason')"
Quality Gates (ALL REQUIRED)
✅ Does service have single, clear responsibility?
✅ Are browser sessions guaranteed to clean up?
✅ Does workflow provide clear user feedback?
✅ Can phases fail independently without breaking system?
✅ Are we using real data from EMD (no fake IDs)?
✅ Are database names descriptive and clear?
✅ Do visual indicators provide immediate understanding?
🆕 UPDATE - August 06, 2025 16:45 PDT
✅ COMPLETED - Progress Bar System Fully Operational
Progress Bar Animation & Duration Estimation

Duration estimation from historical search data (averaging last 10 searches)
Real-time progress animation from 5% to 95% during EMD search phase
Completion animation to 100% when search finishes
Progress text updates with percentage indicators
Proper cleanup and error handling

Backend API Integration

/api/v1/estimate endpoint providing search duration estimates
SearchProgressService with working estimate_search_duration() method
Database persistence of search timing data across sessions
Error handling for API failures with sensible fallbacks

Frontend Progress Implementation

SearchUI class with complete animation methods (animateTo95Percent, completeProgressBar)
Synchronized progress bar with actual EMD search execution
Promise-based coordination between animation and search completion
Proper progress bar lifecycle management

✅ COMPLETED - Static File Serving Resolution
Infrastructure Configuration Fixed

Nginx static file serving configured to serve directly from project directory
File permissions resolved for www-data user access to project files
Eliminated file copying requirement - changes are immediately live
Cache busting mechanisms for JavaScript updates

JavaScript Loading & Execution

Syntax errors resolved in search-ui.js (missing closing braces)
Browser caching issues resolved through proper cache management
SearchUI class loading and initialization working correctly
Complete service initialization in main.js

✅ COMPLETED - Database Configuration Stabilized
Local Database Implementation

SQLite database moved to local storage for reliability (data/reports.db)
All database paths updated and synchronized across services
Schema creation and table initialization working properly
Database service integration with progress tracking

Search Progress Persistence

search_timings table storing historical search duration data
Rolling average calculation for duration estimation
Cross-session persistence for improved user experience
